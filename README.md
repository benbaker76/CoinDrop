# CoinDrop

## Description

This program will allow you to send coin drops to MAME from within your front-end. It runs in the background using a very small amount of CPU. When it detects a coin drop it will play a sound effect and store the amount of coins in memory. When you start MAME you can press the start keys and a credit is automatically registerd and starts the game. Dropping coins outside of MAME means you can carry over credits to multiple games.
